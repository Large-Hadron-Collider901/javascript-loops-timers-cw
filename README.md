# JavaScript Loops and Timer Events - Classwork

### Find the Largest Number in the Array
Write a JavaScript conditional statement to find the largest of the five numbers from the array below. Use an alert box to show the result.

```const myNumberList = [12, 2112, 9000, 1999, 24];```

### Exercise 1: While/For Loops
- Create an empty `name_array`
- Ask the user ```Enter a word. Enter 'q' to quit.``` Add each word they enter to the array
- Create a while loop that will keep asking for words to add to the array until they enter 'q'
- When the user enters 'q' use a **for** loop to print each word from the array
- NOTE: Your code should handle the case of the entered quite letter `Q`

### Exercise 2: Loops - FIZZBUZZ

FIZZBUZZ is a classic Programmer's challenge often used as part of job interviews. 

User inputs the ending value (e.g. 100)

#### Your code should start at 1 and then iterate each number up to the maximum
* If the current number is evenly divisible by 3 you should print "FIZZ" and the number
* If the current number is evenly divisible by 5 you should print "BUZZ" and the number
* If the current number is evenly divisible by both 3 and 5 you should print "FIZZBUZZ" and the number
* Otherwise, just print the number to the console

### Timer Challenge 1:
Animate the included sprite images of 'guy' images. Start with an initial image of `guy1.png` then every .5 second (500 ms) update the image to the next one in sequence. Once you reach image `guy9.png` start over with the `guy1.png` image.

### SUPER MARIO Challenge 2:
Animate Mario walking to the left and right by pressing the left and right arrow keys (HINT: implement event handler(s) for handling the key presses)
